# StratechAssignment

Hi Mr Botha, I need some guidance on how to further this assignment. 

The API I am currently using to get my information from is this one:
https://api-testnet.bybit.com/v2/public/tickers

The problem is that it does not contain the category information or the delta and I am unable to find one that has that information.

My script currently gets the symbol name and the 24 hour volume and then prints the information out in a descending order.  
The information is then printed to a text file with the date and time as the name.

My questions are:
				
				Which API should I use instead?
				
				What analytical data would you like me to store for each symbol?
